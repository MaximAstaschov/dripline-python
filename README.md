# dripline-python
Python implementation of the Dripline framework

The python documentation is done via sphinx and is hosted via github pages.

You can find it [here](http://www.project8.org/dripline) or [here](http://project8.github.io/dripline) (they are literally the same).


Quick Install
-------------

Assuming you just want to install dripline (with all optional dependencies) you can follow the following steps:

1. Activate (or create then activate) your desired virtualenvironment `source /<path_to_virtualenv>/bin/activate`
1. Install dripline with `pip install /<path_to_parentdir>/dripline-python` (to install in develop mode, use `pip install -e` option)

An alternative is to install directly from github.  See [pip documentation]https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git for details on git+VCS support: branch/commit selection and git+ssh options are also available.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/project8/dripline-python
```
