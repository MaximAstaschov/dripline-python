# Dripline package

The root directory of the dripline python package.
All implementation of dripline is in the ``core`` subdirectory for historical reasons.

The ``tests`` subdirectory is for a unit test system which has not been maintained.
Implementing actual unit tests would be a noble endeavor but a more pythonic approach would probably be recommended.
